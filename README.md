#  Customer Churn Analysis & Prediction

##  Project Overview

Customer churn is a critical challenge for subscription-based businesses.
This project analyzes customer behavior to identify key churn drivers and builds a machine learning model to predict customers who are likely to churn, enabling proactive retention strategies.

---

##  Business Objective

* Understand **why customers churn**
* Identify **key behavioral and contractual churn drivers**
* Predict **high-risk customers**
* Support **data-driven retention decisions**

---

##  Tools & Technologies

* **Excel** – Data cleaning, KPI creation, pivot-based analysis
* **SQL** – Churn metrics, segmentation, and validation
* **Python** – Exploratory data analysis, visualization, machine learning
* **Power BI** – Interactive churn dashboard for stakeholders
* **Machine Learning** – Logistic Regression for churn prediction

---

##  Dataset Description

The dataset contains customer demographics, behavior, and subscription details.
Key columns used in the analysis include:

* CustomerID
* Age
* Gender
* Tenure
* Usage Frequency
* Support Calls
* Payment Delay
* Subscription Type
* Contract Length
* Total Spend
* Churn *(Target Variable)*

---

##  Phase 1: Descriptive Churn Analysis

###  Excel

* Data cleaning and preprocessing
* KPI calculation (Churn Rate, Average Tenure, Support Calls)
* Pivot tables to analyze churn across customer segments

###  SQL

* Churn rate calculation using conditional aggregation
* Churn analysis by contract length, subscription type, and age group
* Identification of high-risk customer segments

###  Python (EDA)

* Exploratory data analysis to understand churn patterns
* Visualization of churn against behavioral and financial features
* Validation of insights derived from Excel and SQL

---

##  Phase 2: Power BI Dashboard

* Overall churn KPIs
* Churn distribution by contract length, subscription type, and age group
* Impact of payment delay and support calls on churn
* Identification of high-risk customers

 *Dashboard designed to help business stakeholders monitor churn and take actionable decisions.*

---

##  Phase 3: Machine Learning – Churn Prediction

###  Problem Type

* Supervised binary classification

###  Model Used

* **Logistic Regression**

###  ML Workflow

* Data preprocessing and feature encoding
* Train-test split (80/20)
* Feature scaling using StandardScaler
* Model training and performance evaluation

###  Evaluation Metrics

* Accuracy
* Precision, Recall, and F1-score
* Confusion Matrix

###  Key Insight

Behavioral factors such as **payment delay** and **support calls** emerged as the strongest predictors of customer churn.
