#  Customer Churn Analysis & Prediction

##  Project Overview
Customer churn is a major challenge for subscription-based businesses.  
This project analyzes customer behavior to identify churn drivers and predicts which customers are likely to churn using machine learning, enabling proactive retention strategies.

---

##  Business Objective
- Understand **why customers churn**
- Identify **key churn drivers**
- Predict **high-risk customers**
- Support **data-driven retention decisions**

---

##  Tools & Technologies
- **Excel** – Data cleaning, KPIs, pivot analysis  
- **SQL** – Churn metrics & segmentation analysis  
- **Python** – EDA, visualization, machine learning  
- **Power BI** – Interactive churn dashboard  
- **Machine Learning** – Logistic Regression  

---

##  Dataset Description
Key columns used in the analysis:
- CustomerID
- Age
- Gender
- Tenure
- Usage Frequency
- Support Calls
- Payment Delay
- Subscription Type
- Contract Length
- Total Spend
- Churn (Target Variable)

---

##  Phase 1: Descriptive Churn Analysis

###  Excel
- Data cleaning & preprocessing  
- KPI calculation (Churn Rate, Avg Tenure, Support Calls)  
- Pivot tables for churn segmentation  

###  SQL
- Churn rate calculation using conditional aggregation  
- Churn analysis by contract length, subscription type, and age group  
- Identification of high-risk customer segments  

###  Python (EDA)
- Exploratory data analysis  
- Visualization of churn vs behavioral features  
- Validation of trends observed in Excel and SQL  

---

##  Phase 2: Power BI Dashboard
- Overall churn KPIs  
- Churn by contract length, subscription type, and age group  
- Payment delay & support calls impact on churn  
- High-risk customer identification  

 *Dashboard designed for business stakeholders to monitor churn and take action.*

---

##  Phase 3: Machine Learning – Churn Prediction

###  Problem Type
- Supervised binary classification

###  Model Used
- **Logistic Regression**

###  ML Workflow
- Data preprocessing & feature encoding  
- Train-test split (80/20)  
- Feature scaling using StandardScaler  
- Model training and evaluation  

###  Evaluation Metrics
- Accuracy  
- Precision, Recall, F1-score  
- Confusion Matrix  

###  Key Insight
Behavioral factors like **payment delay** and **support calls** were the strongest predictors of churn.
